```{r}

library(dplyr)
```

# Problem 2
Import and tidy the dataset
```{r, message = FALSE}
homicide_df = 
  read_csv(url("https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-homicides/blob/master/homicide-data.csv?raw=true"))
```
Create a city_state variable (e.g. “Baltimore, MD”), and a binary variable of whether homicide is solved
```{r, warning= FALSE}
homicide_new =
homicide_df %>% 
  mutate(city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = ", ")) %>% 
  group_by(city_state)

cleaned_df =
  homicide_new %>% 
   mutate(
    solve_status = ifelse(disposition %in% c("Closed without arrest", "Open/No arrest"),1,0),
    victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age)
  ) %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  filter( 
          victim_race %in% c("White", "Black"),
         !city_state %in% c("Dallas, TX", "Phoenix, AZ", "Kansas City, MO", "Tulsa, AL")) 

cleaned_df
```
